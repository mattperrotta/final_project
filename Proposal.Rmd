### Project

**Title:** Global Influenza Trends 

**Motivation:** 

All four of us are in the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Concentration and are interested in becoming aquainted with ID Epi modeling in R. 

Last year, in 2018, nearly 80,000 people died from the flu in the US alone. 
_Check out the article [here](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/flu-deaths-2017--2018-cdc-bn/index.html)._

Many scholars argue that there is an impending 'global threat of avian flu' due to rapid globalization and urbanization. 

Understanding current patterns and trends of flu could be useful to build stronger epidemiological frameworks for disease surveillance and emergency preparedness. 


**Final products/Deliverables:**

Report, Statistical Analyses, Webpage, and Screencast

**Anticipated data sources:** 
_The [WHO FluNet](http://apps.who.int/flumart/Default?ReportNo=12)._

**Planned analyses:**

Linear Models 
  
**Potential Indicators or Covariates:**

    * Country or Region
    * Population Size
    * Time or Year
    
**Visualizations:**

    * Seasonal vs. pandemic influenza 
    
**Coding Challenges:**

Scale of Data/ Granularity
